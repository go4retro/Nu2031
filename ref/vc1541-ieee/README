This is the description of the IEEE488 interface published in the
German 64er magazin a long time ago. It is basically modelled
after the 2031 schematics, the IEEE488 sister drive to the VC1541.

Code to patch the VC1541 ROM is provided. The original 2031 ROM
is different in both ROM chips, but the patch manages to get the
changes into one ROM chip only.
